We are happy to announce a return to CS2 Jailbreak! Join us tomorrow, <span style="color:blue">March 14th, 4PM CST / 5PM EST / 2PM PST</span>, for our launch event! We've been gone for a while, but with things settling down in the CS2 world, we believe it's time to bring our mix of JB back into the world. I want to thank <span style="color:green">ThatTamer</span> and <span style="color:darkred">BoTo</span> for their great work on bringing this server into the fray.

You can connect and check out the server by heading to our [servers page](https://landing.steam-gamers.net/servers/). As usual, check out our Discord over [here](https://discord.gg/steamgamers) and get the Jailbreak role, and head to our #jailbreak channel!
