**It's that time of year again, Christmas has arrived to Gmod TTT!**

<span style="color:red">Elfbarf</span> has added some Christmas cheer to our TTT server! For the holiday season our Garry's Mod TTT server is looking quite festive. With all new Christmas-themed maps, and more to come over the holidays, we will be enjoying the snowy weather!

As usual, we play every Tuesday and Saturdays starting at roughly 6PM CST / 7PM EST / 4PM PST, we would love for you to join us and enjoy the Christmas cheer!

To connect, head over to our [servers page](/servers) and click the <span style="color:#4CAF4F">Join</span> button to directly connect from your browser, convenient right?
